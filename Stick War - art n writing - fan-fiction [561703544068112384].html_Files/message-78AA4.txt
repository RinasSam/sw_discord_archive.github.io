Chapter 3 : The last stand
As Kytchu and her army gets defeated by the Chaos fragments
mean while at the capital....
Xiphos : Where the hell are they....
Atreyos : Come on brother we must think of what to do here!
Xiphos : Alright, we shall start planning on what to do. 
*A few hours later after debating with the other generals, Zilaros and Thera*
Zilaros : No! we do not do a banzai charge! We will lose multiple men this way and possibly end the empire!
XIphos : I do not care what you think old man. The capital is priority! We must throw as much men at them if we want to save it!
Zilaros : HAH! You call yourself a general? You do not know how to command an army!
Xiphos : Thera is here! She can help us and increase our chances of winning!
Thera : *hi*
Atreyos : No matter! Our speartons should be able to take some hits and buy time for the rest of the army!
Zilaros : *sigh* Do what you must. But remember our fate is in your hands.
Xiphos : Let us go, our men are waiting for us.
The generals walk outside to the burning city
Swordwrath : Sir! You're finally here! We've been waiting! We have been able to hold them off for quite a while. The merics have been helping us alot!
Xiphos : Good. Get back to the frontlines. We will crush those who oppose us. Once and for all!
Order army : *cheer* 
Xiphos : Come on get in positions, Speartons infront, Swordwrath follow behind, Archidons get in formation and try to support the army.
Magikill summon minions and follow the frontline slowly. Merics get as close to the frontline as possible. Shadowrath, try to hit them from the backs. Get to the roofs and run as fast as possible to the backlines. Once that is done, we will do a final push and finish this long-lasting war!
Order army : *cheer*
Atreyos : I will be by your side at the frontlines
Zilaros : I will stay behind and cast spells
Thera : I will try to heal as much soldiers are possible
Xiphos : Alright. MEN READY?! HENTO TEKKAI BANZAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII !
Order army : **CHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGE!** ***KILL THEM ALL!*** **FOR THE ORDER EMPIRE!**
***ATTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACK!***
