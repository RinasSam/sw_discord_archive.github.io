He was a kind and helpful man, everyone in his village loved him. He has a wife called Rita, the most beautiful girl in the village. They were living a fine life until one day, his wife got very sick. Her conditions got worse everyday, every doctor said she had no hope of recovering and one morning: &quot;She&#39;ll not last any longer.&quot; said the doctor. &quot;But is there anything that would cure her?&quot; Egbert asked. The doctor shook his head as he left Egbert&#39;s house. &quot;What&#39;s wrong my love?&quot; Rita asked. Egbert explained everything to Rita and started to shed tears. &quot;It&#39;s alright, I&#39;ve lived I happy life because of you.&quot; She said. &quot;Oh Rita, why does it have to be like this, why does it have to be you?&quot; He said while crying. &quot;It&#39;s alright my love.&quot; She said witb a bright smile. One cold winter night as he was watching outside, a black robed man appeared right in front of him. He said &quot;I know the cure to your wife&#39;s sickness.&quot; &quot;The doctors said she has no hope of recovering.&quot; Egbert said. But then the man continued &quot;Ah, there&#39;s nothing impossible when it comes to him, he makes anything possible. How about you just listen to me.&quot; Egbert doesn&#39;t know if he could trust this man but he wanted to save Rita&#39;s life.
&quot;Ok I&#39;m listening&quot;
&quot;Good, you must remember what I say, you must seek the grand meric from the holy cathedral, the dark lord of the black tower, and the God of the elements on the mystical countains. Seek their answers.&quot;
&quot;How can I trust you that you&#39;re not tricking me?&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s either up to you whether you trust me or not, here is the map, you should go now if you want to save your wife.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-923727274942033931 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=923727274942033931><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="24-Dec-21 03:02 AM">03:02</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Egbert was about to speak but he heard something from his back and when he turned back to the man, he was gone.

He went into the dead of night, it was a cold journey to the holy cathedral, he somehow lost his ripptor along the way, have crossed a couple of icy rivers and got stuck in the deep powdered snow a few times but he managed to arrived the holy cathedral. As he enters the cathedral, he saw a very beautiful meric in the cathedral, she introduced herself knowing the man doesn&#39;t her. &quot;I am the Grand Meric, I am the one who leads the church. What do you want to seek?&quot; she said. &quot;I am Egbert your holiness, my wife is sick with an incurable disease and someone told me to seek answers from you. How can I cure my wife&#39;s sickness?&quot; He said. The grand meric smiled and said &quot;This is all I can say, love all beings either friend or enemy.

Apparently man got buried below the snow except his head. He knew it will take some time before pulling him back regarding the risk that he might also end up like him but can&#39;t get out what the grand meric said and even though he needs to finish his journey as fast as possible, he helped the man. It took him sometime before pulling him out but he was able to rescue the man. &quot;Ah thank you for helping me! If it wasn&#39;t for you, I could&#39;ve died. I should repay you.&quot; He said. &quot;No need, I would do it like every good man will do.&quot; Egbert said. The man tought for a while and said &quot;Oh don&#39;t be silly, here you should take my fastest ripptor on your journey.&quot; Egbert smiled and appreciated his help, as they both gave their farewells, he went back to his journey and crossed the barren wastelands of the north. His journey was full of big cliffs, cold icy wastelands, dangerous creatures and many more but he was able to arrive to his destination.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-923727650038624336 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=923727650038624336><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="24-Dec-21 03:03 AM">03:03</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>As he entered the tower, he saw that the tower is beautifully decorated hall with a bright red and white floor, walls and even the ceiling, very bright shimmering lights, hanging socks, with red and white twisted canes and in a very big room, there is a beautifully decorated pine tree with colorful ornaments hanging on it. &quot;This is a very jolly home for a necromancer&quot; Egbert thought. There he saw a scary red robed skeleton singing &quot;Tis the season to be evil, gwa ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.&quot; &quot;I hope I won&#39;t end being a dead.&quot; Egbert thought. When Egbert stepped closer, the necromancer spoke. &quot;I knew you were coming, was it about your sick wife?&quot; Egbert is scared but he gathered up all of his courage to say something. &quot;Yes, and you must know what I I&#39;m seeking right?&quot; Even with his fleshless head, he knew he was grinning, he doesn&#39;t know if it was meant to be kind or evil. &quot;Yes, and these are the words I will tell you. Just keep a bright smile even at the worst times. This is a reason why I don&#39;t age. Hahaha! You get it?&quot; The necromancer said. &quot;No...&quot; Egbert said it nervously. &quot;How could you even age when you already looked like you were eaten by a cat.&quot; Egbert muttered. That didn&#39;t helped Egbert from getting any cure for his wife&#39;s illness. He was about to ask the necromancer again but he heard the necromancer muttering something then he lost control of his body and slowly walked outside the tower. &quot;Well have a nice day young man!&quot; the necromancer cried.

As he was searching, he found a village of strange glass people that has something inside their head. They didn&#39;t look so hostile. The village was very bright and happy with bright decorations outside their houses, the trees are decorated with very shiny ornaments and magical shimmering lights around the trees. The people waved to him so he waved them back with a very happy smile. A flying creature approached Egbert and asked him a question. 
&quot;You are looking for something?&quot; 
&quot;I&#39;m looking for the God of the elementals, do you know where I can find him?&quot;
&quot;Hmmmm, here take my hand, I&#39;ll bring you to him.&quot;
&quot;Thank you but why are you so friendly, why are you not asking my intentions?&quot;
&quot;That smile you gave us... It tells us that you don&#39;t have any bad intentions so we think this is the best thing we can do, and visitors rarely come in this place.&quot;

The island is very gorgeous as if mother nature itself decorated it for an occasion.

An Eclipso guard pull over and raise the worker flag near the fireplace alerting the workers that it time for their daily short rest, “Look! it the blue flag we can rest a bit” a miner shout, and so they drop their gear down and start to rest a bit, regaining energy for the next red flag where they need to go back to mining endlessly, one particular miner name Thomas notice the ground cover with white, it the sign of winter and better yet the sign of <strong>Christmas !</strong>. “Wow it Christmas already, wonder if my family still alright in Order” Thomas said, as he say that other miner start to question “What a Christmas?”, Thomas the realize alot of people here got enslaved from different place and thus live a different life with different tradition, “Christmas is just a tradition or more like a holiday in my place where we celebrate the birth of someone very important and exchanging gift”, Thomas story interested all the miners near there and they group around to hear about Christmas.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-923919338442997780 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=923919338442997780><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="24-Dec-21 03:45 PM">15:45</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“Man I wish to experience Christmas too” one miner speak up as all of them snap out to reality, realizing what situation they are in. “What if we can experience Christmas ?” a miner proposes a very bold idea out of the blue making other miners surprise.

<em>It was the middle of winter. Order was pushing the Chaos empire back to their capital, and as they marched upon the lands of the Marrowkai, victory was certain. Morale was high, and the people back at home celebrated the nationwide event of &quot;Argentis Aurax&quot;, taking place during the coldest month, where rare animals would come out of their hiding spots, and when all stars would glimmer like diamonds in the sky. Medusa tried to discuss permanent peace terms with Order, but Order was determined to push on, and erase Chaos off of the face of Inamorta. However, they agreed to a three week peace due to the amount of snowfall and blizzards that prevented both the armies from moving effectively. They could still move, but it was very difficult. Often, taking advantage of the peace treaty, soldiers would sneak into each other&#39;s camps and chat and play games with each other. They got along surprisingly well, with even Juggerknights chatting long into the night with Speartons. The blizzards stopped 2 weeks in, but due to the treaty, there was still a week of peace left. Hordes of soldiers from both armies would flock together, organizing great games and singing songs. For Order, this seemed to be a direct insult by Chaos. For Chaos, this was the faintest hope of not being annihilated, and making peace, as much as they hated it. Almost all the time Medusa would try to convince Zarek and Zilaros to make peace, fully knowing that if she missed this opportunity, the Chaos Empire would be destroyed. A week passed. The treaty had worn off, and both armies refused to fight each other for a small while, although soon war continued. When the fighting began, blood was strewn across pale snow, and soldiers died deaths even before they were stabbed or shot, having to kill their closest friends they made in the past few weeks.</em></span></div><div class=chatlog__reactions><div class=chatlog__reaction title=thumbsup><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=👍 src=Stick%20War%20-%20Events%20-%20fanfic-submissions%20%5B917573168141590608%5D.html_Files/1f44d-82372.svg loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>10</span></div><div class=chatlog__reaction title=sad><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=sad src=Stick%20War%20-%20Events%20-%20fanfic-submissions%20%5B917573168141590608%5D.html_Files/593472202687643685-BB127.png loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>8</span></div></div></div></div></div></div>

 <em><strong>V</strong></em>.
 The most benevolent ruler of all time, who&#39;s name and actions have long since been forgotten.
 Now-a-days he has awoken anew, as an avatar of his true self.
 But now, even with his return, and as his army of Ellementals is raised, it becomes more and more certain that
 <em><strong>V</strong></em> shall never be the one God of Inamorta again.

 For <em><strong>V</strong></em> had not been called a God because of how great a warrior he was. Not because of how corpses fell at his feet. Not because of his army. 

 <em><strong>V</strong></em> was the one true God of Inamorta because he did what the men of inamorta did not. 
 Love. 
 <em><strong>V</strong></em> loved every single person he ever encountered, and his forgiveness knew no bounds. He forgave, and cared for with no end. And the people loved him back for that. Soon,men also began to forgive and forget past sins of their fellowmen. 
 
 <em><strong>V</strong></em>&#39;s love knew <em>no</em> bounds. 
   But the love of men did. 

One day, a&#39; fight&#39; broke out, elledgedly in the name of Love. 
 Two men, who felt had been neglected, argued over who was loved more by <em><strong>V</strong></em>. 
 
 
<em><strong>V</strong></em>&#39; s love was infinite, and as such could not be given un-equally, as everyone was given all the love he had. 
 But men are greedy, and seek to be better than everyone else. 

 The two men decided to settle this argument with a battle. The one who was loved more, would be the victor. 

 One of the men died, but no one won. Guilt, and sorrow overtook the victor to such a degree, that losing would&#39;ve been preferable. 
 From his guilt and shame, he never asked for forgiveness, and hid away as to never be loved again. 
 For the first time, one man had been killed by another. 
 The first crime that ever happened. 
A crime should be punished, but <em><strong>V</strong></em> could not bring himself to punish the wrongdoer, for he still loved him, even if he had killed someone.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="12-Feb-22 04:45 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-942053894761111563 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=942053894761111563><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="12-Feb-22 04:45 PM">16:45</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>As it were, the first man to die would not be the last.

 Men named these large fights &quot;Wars&quot;. And to wage these &#39;wars&#39;, they made the first tools to be constructed without the guidance of <em><strong>V</strong></em>. 
 They called these &quot;weapons&quot;.
As more wars began in the name of love, men began to forget <em><strong>V</strong></em>, and start to love their &#39;weapons&#39; instead. 
 For <em><strong>V</strong></em> could, but would not punish, but men and their weapons could as well...<em>and they did</em>

  <em><strong>V</strong></em>&#39;s ways of love were forgotten, as <em><strong>V</strong></em> himself was replaced by Weapons.

Darthos reached for her hand, and without thought, he placed his hand in her hair. He moved his hand across her hair, it was unimaginably soft, he felt the pulse of his heart quicken. Her whimpers disappeared, and she looked up at him. Darthos stared into her eyes, a beautiful blue that struck into his brown eyes.

Please, state your name.&quot; She smiled and said &quot;My name is Alisandria, it comes from my mother and father.

It was victory upon victory, the chances of returning home was bright, though some losses were severe. 2 of Darthos&#39;s friends were killed so far, the morale of all soldiers were low. Until came the final battle between life and death. The last man standing. The day had began to set, the sky was illuminating with the sun&#39;s glow and warmth. It was too similar to Darthos, what would be stolen from him?</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-942078533419814942 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=942078533419814942><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="12-Feb-22 06:23 PM">18:23</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em>The battle started, 500 rebels against 300 speartons. The battle was rough, though great leadership had managed to get them through. Darthos struck his spear into one, then another. &quot;You dare to defy the orders from the King, he came to our aid and you rebel against us!&quot; Shouted Darthos. His spear striking through their throats and chests. It was all in power, until he was shot by an arrow, it pierced his left thigh and a echoing shout emerged from him. Darthos only began to go into a blood drunk rage, wounding him even more. Cuts and slashes, another arrow that went through his shield and into his arm. He cried, his thoughts of Alisandria began to fade away. He tried to reach for them, but only pain came along. Darthos continued to fight, until he killed the last rebel. 3 arrows were attached to his shield and one in his leg. 53 cuts and slashes throughout his body. Though none were major, but all together it was almost too late. He dropped to his knees, breathing heavily and dehydrated. He stretched out his arm, Alisandria was there. She was slowly crying and grabbed his hand. Her softness stretched through his body. He could still see her golden hair, then reached to feel it. But darkness consumed him. He was then dragged away, and taken to be healed. Blood loss, muscle distortion, and a fever. 4 merics had to carefully heal from for hours. Taking time to delicately seal up wounds and possible infections. Though extremely wounded and hurt, he lived to see another day and more. Returning to the fortress, awaited Alisandria. She tried to recognize his face, but Darthos wasn&#39;t in the front march.</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-942078591179575296 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=942078591179575296><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="12-Feb-22 06:23 PM">18:23</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em>She then broke a tear, and another.

She wailed loudly and only then stopped when she felt a familiar hand on her shoulder. She slowly stared up, and Darthos stared back at her. Wrapped in bandages but his eyes still connected with hers. She launched towards him and hugged him tightly. Crying in joy that he still lived. Darthos hugged her back, noticing her beautiful hair still glowed. The day ended, they laid together on a hill, and watched the night sky. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t have lived, if I&#39;ve never met you before.You saved me, my love.&quot; He turned and watched as she was already coming in for a hug. He caught her, sniffling and said &quot;Thank you.

Eventually, the tears ran dry. Val placed her fingers over Anteria&#39;s eyes, closing them. Then she took out, from a wallet she had on her belt, the blue ribbon she had kept, all these years, for her friend.

Following the tradition of her friend&#39;s desert tribe, she carefully, delicately, wove the ribbon through the fingers of Anteria&#39;s right hand, the one she held her sword with, making sure that the hand never lost its hold on the sword throughout the process. She tied the last knot tight, so that no matter what, her friend ALWAYS had a grip on her sword. Her every movement intentional, purposeful, Val placed two fingers to her lips, then touched them to Anteria&#39;s ribbon bound hand. A great, terrible calm came over Val, then.

What is love?

Is it something that exists merely as an emotion? An attraction between a man and a woman that ensures the survival of the myriad races of Inamorta and beyond? Is it something more: perhaps something that is connected to the choices we can choose to make? Can love be shared between two close friends, without romance? Can we choose love, can we choose to love in multiple ways and with multiple people?

What is its purpose? When the Coder forged us out of nothingness, out of words spoken and sticks drawn onto the Glowing Table, was there intentional inclusion of this relationship as part of our design? Why do we bear this burden that shackles us with unspeakable grief when the other departs from us, gone forever? Why not leave it out, so that people can numbly live on without knowing the sublime joys or devastating loss love brings with it?

When do we see it? When does its power shine forth as strongly as the light of the User in the dark night? When does it give us courage and strength to work hard to preserve the life of the other? Does it show itself in the lowest pauper who <em>bravely</em> works day and night as a cobbler to support his family instead of leaving? Does it show itself in a comrade leaping into the way of an arrow, trading their own life for the other? Does it show in the little things, like keeping a little token of the other person for them for years, never forgetting to have it ready to use in the darkest moment?

Where is it? Is it something in the meat of our flesh and brain, something that drives our actions against our will so that we &quot;fall helplessly in love&quot;?

Where is the part of one&#39;s body that you can cut out that both allows them to keep living and yet to cease loving? Does it even exist?

We recognize that they are not the same as the other tribes, and that doesn&#39;t bother us. When multitudes come to look at the great mystery from multiple angles of approach, is it not obvious that they would all see something different? We know that even our own answers are incomplete, for no mortal could ever hope to fully grasp the infinite. It almost feels more helpful to state the questions than the answers. The more questions you answer, the more that spring up.

That is what makes it beautiful. Something worth having, and exploring. And though we all travel different roads, and different paths, and though we all are different from each other in unlimited ways, we <em>all</em> share this gift, both simple and labyrinthine, that transcends the differences between us, that brings us together in small moments. We all share in this blessing, something that could bring us all back across the chasm of hatred that separated us in the Great River, if only we all tried to choose it.

If you have read this far, you are willing to hear our answer, just as I am willing to hear yours. You know as I do that my answer is incomplete, and that it may look strange or wrong to you, and you are still willing to hear what I believe love truly is.

V wanted love but he didn&#39;t know what it was. V was a legend. He was a god, but yet knew nothing about love. What it could do for someone, but... he did know friendship. Was that anything like love? V lived in Sky Mountain, the tallest mountain in all of Inamorta. He disappeared after a death of his friend. He couldn&#39;t handle it. After his friend died, V tried to gain so much power hoping that one day he could revive them for they were the only thing he cared for. V didn&#39;t want to share his story with you, the reader, but he told me.

He was like a soulless war machine. That is what people called him. Training was all he did. He lived all alone with no one. He didn&#39;t talk to anyone either. It was like fate was set for him the day he was born, that was until he came. Jhon. He was one of the weakest in the group but he was always goofing around and never took anything seriously. Jhon was a new member of the swordwrath army but he quickly made friends with everyone. On Jhon&#39;s 3rd day he took everyone for a drink and there was a whole party. V didn&#39;t go of course. When Jhon took everyone for the party V assumed that Jhon was a guy who didn&#39;t take his job seriously and always goofed off, he was correct but V also assumed that he would cower if there was a battle. V was wrong. Very wrong. On the day of the battle against the deads, rumors said the battle would be endless and many men had resigned. Jhon however, was one of the only men who went out to fight. V also did and the battle was indeed hectic but V barely had gotten any scratches on him. Even at that time, V was very powerful but then V heard the scream of Jhon. Jhon was heavily injured with many deads crawling toward him. Even in that pain Jhon still fought the deads but Jhon fell down and the deads were surrounding him. Jhon couldn&#39;t run away until V saved him. V didn&#39;t know why he did and he didn&#39;t want to know either. As V killed all the deads Jhon looked at V, awe at how powerful he was. A bit after that they became friends. Now, I don&#39;t have any details on what happened after the dead war so I can&#39;t tell you how they became friends. V helped Jhon. They practiced fighting but V always won. Jhon tried to have fun with V, though it was hard.

V could hardly fight them off, he could still manage but they were indeed powerful. Jhon fought with V side by side, but then a large swordwrath had attacked Jhon. The large swordwrath looked like the strongest of them all. V charged towards the man with rage and 1v1 started with both sides being very powerful. V was winning but the large man did a swordwrath move that V did not know. V could tell it was a move that was Elite. The man then picked up Jhon&#39;s unconscious body from the ground. V got hit hard and fell to the ground but he got up quickly but what he saw was Jhon&#39;s body being held by the man, with a sword in his chest.

<em>I adore you, my beloved.

I know reading that makes you, in all your perfect modesty, blush with embarrassment, though at the end of the day, I know you like to hear that, and writing that fills my soul with warmth. 

It has been such a long time since I last wrote to you; so many years have gone by, but I know you’ll forgive me. You understand how pessimistic I can be sometimes, how stubborn I always seem to be, and how I saw there was no logic in writing.

But now, my beloved wife, I know that I cannot falter and delay any longer. I want to tell you that I love you. I will always love you.

Even after so long, after so much, I sometimes still struggle to comprehend what that means: to love you when you are gone. When I lay my head down to rest, my mind still yearns for you, joyfully and then forlornly, awaiting for when we will be reunited once more. Without you, I feel alone - you were the driving force behind all our glorious adventures. More frequently than not, I question whether I can even live another day, and whether I should hasten to reach our final meeting. 

But then I feel the tugging of my robes; hear the grunts of obedient assent and chuckles of bemusement; see the eye-rolling and smiles of the individuals we brought into this world. Our children. The shining beacons of Order in the darkness. The fruit of our love and care. Our joy and pride. Because of you, I am not alone, and never will be.</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-947683201898393650 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=947683201898393650><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="28-Feb-22 05:34 AM">05:34</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>.
<em>I remember everything you told me. You liberated me from the grim chains that bound me during my youth, and guided me to find myself anew. Sheltered by the walls that were your compassion, intelligence and courage, I learned to see what peace and knowledge truly meant. I am so overwhelmingly indebted to you, not that you would allow such a debt to be present in love. Amid the tempest of fear and tragedy, it was pure bliss to witness our great proverbial riches. As much as it sometimes pains me to think, I know I cannot join you just yet. But I am comforted by the fact you think the exact same.

When I step onto the balconies and battlements, the memories of all you achieved come flowing in. You are the bulwark against which the most powerful armies of Inamorta would be shattered against. Mother of the nation, bane of tyrants, fortress of Order. When others fell and broke, you held firm and brought us hope. You rallied the people and restored peace and knowledge to our nation. To this day, I cannot understand what I did to deserve your grace and love.

One particular memory stands out when I contemplate this point: I remember taking you in my arms and kissing you under the brilliant sky, high upon the walls. The people were staring, but we did not care. As it turns out, the people loved you too, the wife and better half to a headstrong crown-flouting fool. So much in fact, they renamed Castle Ordiris in honour of you. Castle Iris stands watching vigilantly over the lands, as it shall continue to do so for many years. 

Far in the future, that castle will eventually vanish, along with everything else we know in Inamorta. But my love for you will endure forever. 

My beloved wife, I adore you.

Zarek</em></span></div><div class=chatlog__reactions><div class=chatlog__reaction title=yes_S><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=yes_S src=Stick%20War%20-%20Events%20-%20fanfic-submissions%20%5B917573168141590608%5D.html_Files/740935372934086686-55F67.png loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>6</span></div><div class=chatlog__reaction title=thumbsup><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=thumbsup src=Stick%20War%20-%20Events%20-%20fanfic-submissions%20%5B917573168141590608%5D.html_Files/565770135756079105-7B12E.png loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>5</span></div><div class=chatlog__reaction title=scream><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=😱 src=Stick%20War%20-%20Events%20-%20fanfic-submissions%20%5B917573168141590608%5D.html_Files/1f631-6EBDD.svg loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>4</span></div><div class=chatlog__reaction title=sad><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=sad src=Stick%20War%20-%20Events%20-%20fanfic-submissions%20%5B917573168141590608%5D.html_Files/593472202687643685-BB127.png loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>3</span></div><div class=chatlog__reaction title=100><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=💯 src=Stick%20War%20-%20Events%20-%20fanfic-submissions%20%5B917573168141590608%5D.html_Files/1f4af-569BF.svg loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>4</span></div></div></div></div></div></div>
